## Conducted analysis on client's transaction dataset and identified customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations
### Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. I was a data scientist contracted by  the Quantium analytics team and i was responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customerâ€™s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful.
