# Contains 4 different files for each of the processes, data cleaning 1, data cleaning 2, EDA and Modelling and evaluated
## Aim: To develop predictive models in metered building energy usage(How much energy will a building consume?)
##Objectives: To use the models built to check how much energy a building uses based on previous energy efficient improvements.
## Business Understanding: 1. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies
### 2. By developing better and more accurate models, ASHRAE would know how good the previous energy efficient improvement methods were and try to improve on those.
### 3. To know which meter type(chilled water, electric, hot water, steam meters) is better suited to savings on energy consumption and contributes most to energy efficient methods
### 4. Which meter types contribute the most to energy consumption? Which saves the most energy?
### 5. What are the factors that contribute to energy consumption?
### 6. Which time of the day or month of the year is energy consumed the most or saved the most?
