# Stack Overflow 2019 analysis
## Articles of findings, can be found in my blog here ---> https://hkampadu.wordpress.com/2020/11/04/what-contributes-to-higher-salaries-among-developers/
## In this project, i analyzed the responses of over 70000 people who partook in the annual survey. The motivation mostly was to find the factors that contributed to higher  ## salaries among developers. Also to analyze and address the notion that people need higher degrees for certain types of developer jobs and much more.
